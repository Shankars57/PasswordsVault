# Optional (set automatically by platform)
NODE_ENV=production
```

## DNS & Domain (Optional)

If using custom domain:

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Identify Issue**
   - Check error logs
   - Review recent changes
   - Test locally if possible

2. **Quick Fix vs Rollback**
   - Minor issue: Deploy hotfix
   - Major issue: Rollback to previous version

3. **Rollback Steps**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous commit
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main

   # Or redeploy previous version in platform
   ```

4. **Communicate**
   - Notify users of issue
   - Provide timeline for fix
   - Update when resolved

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Can't connect to MongoDB"

**Solutions:**
- Verify connection string
- Check IP whitelist in Atlas
- Ensure MongoDB cluster is running
- Test connection with MongoDB Compass

### Issue: "Build fails"

**Solutions:**
- Check build logs
- Verify Node.js version (18+)
- Clear cache and rebuild
- Check for syntax errors

### Issue: "JWT errors"

**Solutions:**
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set
- Check secret is same across deployments
- Clear browser cookies
- Regenerate tokens

### Issue: "Slow performance"

**Solutions:**
- Enable MongoDB indexes
- Upgrade hosting tier
- Optimize queries
- Enable CDN for static assets

## Security Incident Response

If security issue discovered:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate JWT secret
   - Force all users to re-login
   - Review logs for suspicious activity
   - Patch vulnerability

2. **Investigation**
   - Identify scope of breach
   - Determine affected users
   - Document timeline
   - Preserve evidence

3. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Explain what happened
   - Detail remediation steps
   - Provide security recommendations

4. **Prevention**
   - Update security measures
   - Add monitoring
   - Review code
   - Conduct security audit
